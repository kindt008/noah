This was a mini-project for my bioinformatics class in the Fall of 2018. I measured the variability of each position in given rRNA strands. Then I had to find the regions of the rRNA where the variance is greatest. This is valuable information in genomics, it is where mutations are likely to occur and helps with predicting protein folding.
The raw data is in Homework_4_seqs.fna. It is analyzed in exercise04.py. Intermediate data is put out in mat.txt and result.txt to be read in by matlab program mat.m which provides a plotting program. Variable_regions.txt holds the results of the experiment, stating which x values represent a position of great variability.
The value of what defines a "variable" region and the amount the plot is normalized had to be adjusted experimentally. Outliers and edge cases are especially common in genomics. Many values in the program are arbitrary.

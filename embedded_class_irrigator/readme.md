This was my final project for CSCI 5143, real time and embedded systems. Where I designed a device that uses a soil sensor to automatically water a plant whenever the sensor determines the soil has gotten too dry (using soil resistance). Detailed summaries and pictures will be posted before October.
A basic navigation is that under the "examples" folder is code that uses arduino libraries. The most functional one being main_a.ino. This takes advantage of an arduino function "pulseIn" that uses an ultrasonic distance sensor to track the water level in the jug where the water was stored. My attempts to write it in the root folders main.c were unreliable.
Main.c and util.c contain the majority of the interesting code that attempts to finish the project independently of arduino libraries.
